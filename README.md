Perfect Stack Splitter allows players to perfectly split item stacks in any kind of inventory with ease. Inspired by the stack splitting system in Satisfactory, this mod enhances Minecraft's inventory management by providing a smooth and efficient way to handle item stacks.

Key Features:
- Universal Inventory Support: Whether you're using a player's inventory, a chest, furnace, or any container, you can split stacks in all types of inventories.
- One-Second Hold Activation: Simply hold the right mouse button for one second on any stack of items to trigger the stack splitting feature. (TBD : Configurable)
- Custom Stack Splitting GUI: Once activated, a custom graphical interface, similar to Satisfactory's stack splitter, opens, allowing you to select the exact number of items to split from the stack using a slider or input field
